/// Immutable object that represents a single help document: a container for all help content for a
/// certain broad topic.
///
/// Help document is divided into sections, that by themselves are divided into items. Section is
/// intended to group items by a certain common context, like a currently selected tool, while items
/// give the ability to provide different types of content, like images, videos, etc.
///
/// Broadly speaking, help document is like a web page, sections are like top level \c <div> tags,
/// and items are like html tags and widgets.
///
/// @note that while the the general design idea is for the help document to contain only content,
/// and not styling (aka html, and not css), some elements do break this rule. Nevertheless, try not
/// to extend this breakage.

/// Creates and returns a help document for the given JSON \c path.
/// If an error occurred while reading the file or deserializing it, \c nil will be returned and
/// \c error will be populated with \c LTErrorCodeFileReadFailed. If \c path is \c nil, \c nil will
/// be returned and \c error will be set to \c LTErrorCodeFileNotFound.
///
/// @note the JSON file supports showing videos, slideshows and images. See the following examples:

///     "type": "video",
