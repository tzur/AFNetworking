/// Immutable model representing a brush. A brush is determined by a set of well-defined parameters
/// in form of a model which can be used to construct corresponding objects capable of rendering
/// geometry along a curve, yielding a so-called brush stroke. The aforementioned geometry resides
/// in a well-defined two-dimensional orthonormal coordinate system called the "brush stroke
/// geometry coordinate system". The unit of both coordinate axes is inch, in order to ensure
/// device-independence.
///
/// There are two main ways for constructing aforementioned geometry:
/// a) "Brush tip geometry": the geometry is iteratively constructed as individual, possibly
/// overlapping "brush tips".
/// b) "Vector stroke geometry": the geometry is constructed as a consecutive set of non-overlapping
/// geometries.
///
/// Brush models have a unique version, the so-called brush model \c version, used to determine all
/// derived objects.
