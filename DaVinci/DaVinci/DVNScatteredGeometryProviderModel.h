/// Model of an \c id<DVNGeometryProvider> that provides \c dvn::GeometryValues with randomly

/// The returned \c dvn::GeometryValues are constructed by manipulating the \c dvn::GeometryValues
/// returned by an internal \c id<DVNGeometryProvider> which is constructed from a
/// \c id<DVNGeometryProviderModel> model given upon initialization.
///
/// The manipulation is performed as follows: First, each quad returned by the
/// \c valuesFromSamples:end: method of the internal \c id<DVNGeometryProvider> is duplicated \c x
/// times, where \x is randomly chosen from <tt>{minimumCount, ..., maximumCount}<\tt> for every
/// quad. Afterwards, a random affine transformation is applied to each of the quads, that is
/// constructed from translation, roatation and scaling. Every quad is assigned with the index of
/// the quad it was duplicated from. The \c samples of the \c dvn::GeometryValues returned by the
/// aforementioned internal \c id<DVNGeometryProvider> are left unchanged.
