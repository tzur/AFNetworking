/// Object representing a pipeline for iteratively rendering quadrilateral geometry constructed from
/// a given parameterized object. The pipeline consists of several stages which are executed
/// consecutively and linearly. The setup of the pipeline stages is performed using an immutable
/// configuration model provided upon initialization. Upon initialization, the objects performing
/// the stage tasks are constructed from the relevant submodels of the configuration model. This
/// inversion of control allows for different implementations of the pipeline stages.
///
/// The stages executed by the pipeline are:
/// 1. Sampling stage:
///      In this first stage, the given parameterized object is sampled, using the sampler
///      constructed from the corresponding model provided upon initialization.
/// 2. Geometry stage:
///      In this stage, quadrilateral geometry is constructed from the samples returned by the
///      sampling stage. The object responsible for the geometry construction is created from the
///      corresponding model provided upon initialization.
/// 3. Texture mapping stage:
///      In this stage, for each of the quadrilaterals returned by the geometry stage, an assignment
///      of texture coordinates to every vertex of the quadrilateral is performed.
/// 4. Attribute stage:
///      In this stage, for each of the quadrilateral returned by the geometry stage, auxiliary
///      attributes are assigned for every vertex of the quadrilateral.
/// 5. Render stage:
///      In this final stage, the data constructed by the geometry, texture mapping and attribute
///      stages are provided to a renderer producing the desired rendering. The renderer is
///      initialized with the shader code and auxiliary data provided by the corresponding model.
///
/// The discussed order of pipeline stages is also reflected by the occurrences of their
/// corresponding configuration models in the \c DVNPipelineConfiguration model.
///
/// The objects composing the pipeline might or might not be stateful. Hence, this pipeline object
/// must be assumed to be stateful. The current state of the object can be retrieved (in form of a
/// \c DVNPipelineConfiguration object) by calling the method \c currentConfiguration.
///
/// The pipeline does not assume any specific render target. It is the responsibility of the user to
/// to ensure the usage of an appropriate render target.
///
/// @important It is the responsibility of the user to a) provide a pipeline configuration whose
/// stages work together and b) to execute the pipeline only using parameterized objects that can be
/// handled by the stages. For example, if the \c id<LTContinuousSampler> object used in the
/// sampling stage assumes that the parameterized object has a parameterization key \c foo, all
/// parameterized objects with which the pipeline is executed must provide the required key \c foo.
