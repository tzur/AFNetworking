/// Implementation of the ImageZero lossless compression algorithm, including a proprietary file
/// format which is not defined in the original implementation. The implementation of ImageZero is
/// multithreaded when possible for maximal performance and stores each compressed image in a number
/// of shards (similar to archive formats such as RAR). This allows ImageZero to be amazingly fast
/// (x2.8 faster than JPEG compression on average on iPhone 6+) while keeping the file size sane
/// (only 40% larger than JPEG) and the pixel data lossless.
///
/// The file format contains a header, which defines the current version, total image size and
/// current shard size and index, followed by the ImageZero compressed data. The compressed data and
/// the header, besides specific documented fields, are stored in little endian format. Each pixel's
/// value is predicted using its top, left and top-left neighbours (when available), and only the
/// difference between the predictor and the actual value is stored. The bit length of each pixel is
/// encoded using a static Huffman table.
///
/// @important current implementation only supports R8 and RGBA8 images.
///
/// @important this file format is intended for internal app use only. Header and data abuse may
/// cause decompression code to corrupt memory and/or to crash.
///
/// @see http://imagezero.maxiom.de/ and https://github.com/cfeck/imagezero for more information and
/// the original implementation.
