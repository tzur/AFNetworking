/// called as a result of manual termination requests.

/// touches. Both the \c touchEvents and the \c predictedTouchEvents are ordered according to their
/// timestamps. The timestamps are monotonically increasing also for consecutive calls to this
/// method. The given \c contentTouchEvents contain at least one content touch event. If the given
