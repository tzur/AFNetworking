/// Category which adds a factory on top of LTTexture's abstract class. The factory chooses the
/// appropriate \c LTTexture subclass to instantiate, based on hardware compatibilities and
/// performance considerations.

/// Creates an empty texture on the GPU. Throws \c LTGLException with
/// \c kLTOpenGLRuntimeErrorException if texture creation failed.
///
/// @param size size of the texture. Must be integral.
///
/// @param pixelFormat pixel format the texture is stored in the GPU with. The format must be
/// supported on the target platform, or an \c NSInvalidArgumentException will be thrown.
///
/// @param maxMipmapLevel maximal mipmap level, with \c 0 meaning that only a single level exists.
///
/// @param allocateMemory an optimization recommendation to implementors of this class. If set to
/// \c YES, the texture's memory will be allocated on the GPU (but will not be initialized - see
/// note). Otherwise, the implementation will try to create a texture object only without allocating
/// the memory, and a call to \c load: or \c loadRect:fromImage: will be required to allocate
/// memory on the device.
///
/// @note The texture memory is not allocated until a call to \c load: or \c loadRect: is made, and
/// only the affected regions are set to be in a defined state. Calling \c storeRect:toImage: with
/// an uninitialized rect will return an undefined result.
