/// Immmutable value object representing the discrete state of a touch (event) sequence associated
/// with a view. A touch event sequence starts with an input device (e.g. finger, stylus, etc.)
/// entering the area in which touches are sensorically recognized and ends either due to the input
/// device leaving that area or due to cancellation. A sequence consists of a discrete series of
/// touch events which are result of the discretization of the sequence according to the sampling
/// rate of the device sensors. In iOS, a touch event sequence is represented by a single \c UITouch
/// object that persists during the entire sequence. According to the documentation of \c UITouch,
/// any such object should never be retained. Hence, this class is used to store the current state
/// of a given \c UITouch object.
