/// The \c guide and the \c input must be either R or RGBA textures. The combination of R guide and
/// RGBA input is not supported.

/// The coefficients textures can be smaller than the \c input texture but must have the same size

/// The \c kernelSizes array length must be equal to the \c scaleCoefficients and
/// \c shiftCoefficients arrays length. Each value in \c kernelSizes must be an odd number in
/// <tt>[3, 999]</tt> range.
