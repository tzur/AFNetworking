/// Source providing assignments from Taplytics.
///
/// Taplytics experiment must be configured in a certain way in order to be exposed by this class.
/// By design, the Taplytics SDK does not provide the assignments of each active variant, and only
/// provides a list of active variants and a list of active assignments without any link between the
/// lists.
///
/// Due to this design, when setting up an experiment in Taplytics, another meta key should be added
/// to the list of keys in the experiment, specifying the names of the keys in the experiment.
/// This meta key should have the name "__Keys_<Experiment Name>" and it's value must be a JSON
/// array containing the names of the keys in the experiment (excluding other meta keys).
///
/// Also, any experiment having the prefix "__Remote_" is ignored by this source, as this prefix
/// marks the experiment as remote configuration, which is not supported by Laboratory.
///
/// When the \c stabilizeUserExperienceAssignments method is called for the first time, the source
/// stores the active variants and their assignments to \c storage. On subsequent runs, these stored
/// variants and assignemts are returned as the \c activeVariants. That means that new experiments
/// will not be exposed, and any change in the assigments or in the activity of the experiment, is
/// not exposed, up to the following exceptions:
///
/// 1. Experiemtns archived in Taplytics are removed from \c activeVariants.
/// 2. Assignments with overriden keys. To set overrriden keys create a meta key with the name
/// "__Override_<Experiment Name>" with a JOSN array value containing the names of the keys you want
/// to overide. In that case the string values in the array will be treated as keys that should not
/// be pulled from the storage, but their value should be pulled from the latest value in Taplytics.
///
/// You should use overriden key when certain keys for experiments need to be updated even though
/// \c stabilizeUserExperienceAssignments has been previously called.
///
/// Any Taplytics custom data can be added using the \c customData parameter. The given custom data
/// is augmented with the experiments token provided by the \c experimentsTokenProvider using the
/// key "ExperimentsToken". You can use custom data to send applilcation specific data to Taplytics,
/// then you can use the data to distribute experiments to users with specific data.
