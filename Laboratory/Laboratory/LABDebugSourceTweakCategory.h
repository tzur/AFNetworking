/// Tweak category that exposes tweaks according to the experiments and sources of an

///
///  1. "Inactive" - Default value of the tweak. When selected, the experiment becomes inactive.
///  2. All available variants. When a variant is selected it activates that variant in the debug
///  source.
///
/// The Tweaks in a collection are ordered by experiment name. The possible values for a tweak are
/// sorted by variant name, instead of \c "Inactive" which is always last.
///
/// @note Implements \c update, which in turn updates the \c debugSource.
/// @note Implements \c reset, which sets all the experiments to be inactive.
