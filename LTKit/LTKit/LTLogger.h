NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

// For Objective-C code, this library adds flexible, non-intrusive logging capabilities
// that can be efficiently enabled or disabled via compile switches.
//
// There are four levels of logging: Info, Warning, Error and Debug, and each can be enabled
// independently via the LOGGING_LEVEL_INFO, LOGGING_LEVEL_WARNING, LOGGING_LEVEL_ERROR and
// LOGGING_LEVEL_DEBUG preprocessor variables, respectively.
//
// In addition, ALL logging can be enabled or disabled via the LOGGING switch.
//
// Logging functions are implemented here via macros. Disabling logging, either entirely, or
// at a specific level, completely removes the corresponding log invocations from the compiled
// code, thus eliminating both the memory and CPU overhead that the logging calls would add.
// You might choose, for example, to completely remove all logging from production release code,
// by setting LOGGING off in your production builds settings. Or, as another example,
// you might choose to include Error logging in your production builds by turning only LOGGING
// and LOGGING_LEVEL_ERROR on, and turning the others off.
//
// To perform logging, use any of the following function calls in your code:
//
// LogDebug(fmt, ...) - recommended for temporary use during debugging.
//
// LogInfo(fmt, ...) - recommended for general, infrequent, information messages.
//
// LogWarning(fmt, ...) - recommended for use only when there is an warning to be logged.
//
// LogError(fmt, ...) - recommended for use only when there is an error to be logged.
//
// In each case, the functions follow the general NSLog/printf template, where the first argument
// "fmt" is an NSString that optionally includes embedded Format Specifiers, and subsequent optional
// arguments indicate data to be formatted and inserted into the string. As with NSLog, the number
// of optional arguments must match the number of embedded Format Specifiers. For more info, see the
// core documentation for NSLog and String Format Specifiers.
