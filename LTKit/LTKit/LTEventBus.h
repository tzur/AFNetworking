/// Provides a mechanism for broadcasting notifications about events that happened. Anyone can
/// broadcast and anyone can register to be notified, for any event.
/// Receivers register to a \c Class, and will be notified with all events that are of that class
/// or a subclass of it.
///
/// Receivers of the events are called synchronously from \c post:.
///
/// This class is inspired by Guava's EventBus, see
/// https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained

/// Registers to be notified when events of a specific class are posted. The target's selector will
/// be called when an event of this class, or a subclass of it, is posted.
///
/// The same target can be registered multiple times without limits, and will be called once for
/// each registration that matches the posted class.
/// For example: a target registers twice, for \c NSObject class and for \c NSString class. When a
/// \c NSString object is posted, the target is called twice. This will happen even if the same
/// selector is registered for both classes.
///
/// The method specified by \c selector must return void and accept a single object parameter, as in
/// @code
/// - (void)handleEvent:(id)object;
/// @endcode
/// Calling with any other signature will raise \c NSInvalidArgumentException. \c LTEventBus
/// guarantees the selector will be called only with a subtype of the class it was registered with.
///
/// \c target is held weakly. It is \b not required to unregister before \c dealloc.

/// each registration that matches the posted protocol.
/// For example: a target registers twice, for \c id<NSObject> and for \c id<NSURLProtocolClient>.
