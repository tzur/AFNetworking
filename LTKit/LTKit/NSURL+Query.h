/// @note \c NSURL and \c NSURLComponents treat empty and missing queries differently. Missing query

/// query means that the query component is present, but is empty. In this case, \c query is an
/// empty string.
///
/// The same holds for this property: \c queryItems is is \c nil when query is missing, and empty
/// when query is empty. This is exactly the same as <tt>-[NSURLComponents queryItems]</tt>.
///
/// For example:
///
/// <tt>"scheme://host/path/foo"</tt> -> \c nil
///
/// <tt>"scheme://host/path/foo?"</tt> -> \c @[]

/// @see <tt>-[NSURLComponents queryItems]</tt> for the details of this representation.

/// @note while this property offers a convenient way to access URL's \c query string, it does not
/// represent it uniquely. For example, the original ordering and duplicates are not preserved, and
/// there is no way to distinguish between <tt>"key="</tt> and <tt>"key"</tt> query strings.
