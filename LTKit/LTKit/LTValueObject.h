/// An abstract base class for value objects, using reflection to provide sensible default
/// behaviors.
///
/// This class should be treated an implementation detail, i.e. <tt>LTValueObject *</tt> should
/// never be used. The class provides default implementations for \c description, \c isEqual: and
/// \c hash.
///
/// \c description is implemented by iterating the class property list, and concatenating a string
/// in the format of <tt><[class name]: [pointer value], [p1 name]: [p1 description](, ...)></tt>
/// where <tt>(, ...)</tt> represents one or more additional properties in the format
/// <tt>, [p name]: [p description]<tt>, and \c description inidicates the property's \c description
/// method.
///
/// \c isEqual: is implemented by iterating the class property list, comparing each value by both
/// pointer and its own \c isEqual: method.
///
/// \c hash is implemented by iterating the class property list, and performing \c lt::hash_combine
/// on each property's \c hash value.
///
/// If any of these implementation do not suffice and require more specific behavior the relevant
/// method must be overridden. This includes but does not limit to requiring \c std::hash instead of
/// \c hash, requiring a more robust description of structs such as \c CGSize or requiring only some
/// properties to be compared, hashed or described.
///
/// @note The properties of classes inheriting from this class must all respond to \c isEqual:,
/// \c hash and \c description themselves, or do so in their boxed form if they are primitive.
///
/// @important This class uses reflection to operate which may come with a performance cost. You
/// must not inherit from this class if a class requires performant implementations of these
/// methods.
///
/// @important This class does not support \c weak properties. You must not inherit from this class
/// if a class contains any \c weak properties. Attepting to use the methods provided by this class
/// in a class with \c weak properties will raise an \c NSInternalInconsistencyException.
///
/// @important This class assumes no dynamic alteration, i.e. adding or removing properties of
/// during runtime. You must not inherit from this class if a class is expected to dynamically alter
/// during runtime.
