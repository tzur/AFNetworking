/// If any of these implementation do not suffice and require more specific behavior the relevant

/// \c hash, requiring a more robust description of structs such as \c CGSize or requiring only some
/// properties to be compared, hashed or described.

/// \c hash and \c description themselves, or do so in their boxed form if they are primitive.

/// @important This class uses reflection to operate which may come with a performance cost. You
/// must not inherit from this class if a class requires performant implementations of these
/// methods.
///
/// @important This class does not support \c weak properties. You must not inherit from this class
/// if a class contains any \c weak properties. Attepting to use the methods provided by this class
/// in a class with \c weak properties will raise an \c NSInternalInconsistencyException.
