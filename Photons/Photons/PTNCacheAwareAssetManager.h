/// @important For the caching to operate correctly the conforming asset manager must return

/// objects for any \c -fetchDescriptor: \c -fetchAlbumWithURL: and
/// \c -fetchImageWithDescriptor:resizingStrategey:options respectively. Additionally
/// \c PTNImageAsset objects must also conform to the \c PTNDataAsset protocol.

/// Returns a signal that sends \c YES if the \c PTNAlbum identified with \c entityTag (if
/// originally provided for the album) represents the album that would have been fetched with

/// error code if an error occurred while validating the album.

///
/// An example of when this is useful is when images sizes are bucketed. In Dropbox for example,
/// fetching is possible in a number of distinct sizes, such as \c 128x128 and \c 640x480. When
/// requesting an image of size 200x200, it will return the 640x480 version and cache it, how ever
/// all requested sizes up-to 640x480 can share that cached resource.
