/// Represents a model that is backed by \c BLUTree. In contrast to \c BLUTree, the model is a
/// stateful object that holds the latest tree that was produced from the series of transformations
/// on the model.
///
/// The model allows to mutate itself by replacing a value of a node or its child nodes (but not
/// renaming its path or deleting existing nodes). The mutations can be observed by observing a
/// specific node for changes or by observing the entire backing tree and retriving the new tree
/// once the mutation is complete.
///
/// The model itself cannot be modified by an external client. To modify the model, one need to
/// create a node in the initial given \c tree that holds a value that implements the
/// \c BLUProviderDescriptor protocol. This descriptor describes how to create a provider that will
/// be attached to the model and mutate it when data is added, changed or removed.
///
/// @important This class is thread safe, so multiple mutations on the model can be performed from
/// multiple threads while keeping the model consistent. However, it is not reentrant safe when
/// reentering from multiple threads. Such operation may yield a deadlock.
