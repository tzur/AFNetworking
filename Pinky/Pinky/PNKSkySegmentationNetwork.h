/// Network for segmentation of skies. The output of this network is an image, the same size as the
/// input, and has 2 channels. The first channel represents the confidence in the segmentation of
/// skies in the image such that pixels included in the sky get a high value and pixels in other
/// classes, i.e. the background, get a low value. The second channel represents the confidence of
/// all classes that are not sky and are called "background". The architecture of this network is a
/// proprietary one composed of a downsampling stage encoding the image while downsampling it twice
/// in a dyadic manner. Then the created tensor is encoded in 5 residual blocks with dilated
/// convolution for enlarged receptive fields. The tensor is then upsampled and concatenated with
/// tensors from the downsampling stage via skip connections. Finally the last tensor passes through
/// a pixel-wise convolution to create the confidence maps per class.
